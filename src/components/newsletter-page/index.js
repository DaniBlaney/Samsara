              <h4>Backpack Safety is Back-to-School Issue</h4>
              <h5>Chiropractic Research</h5>

              <p>Concern over children and their backpacks continues to grow.
                 An article appearing in the The Times Herald features this
                 problem by noting "Trudging their way around the school campus
                 or to the bus stop, hunched-over kids could be dealing themselves
               a lifetime of back pain, experts warn."</p>
              <p>The US Consumer Product Safety Commission estimates that 6,512
                emergency room visits each year result from injuries related to
                book bags. CPSC also cites the statistic that backpack-related
                injuries are up 256 percent since 1996. The issue has become so
                widespread, that the California State Assembly passed legislation
                that forces school districts to develop ways of reducing the weight
              of students' backpacks. Other states are also considering similar legislation.</p>
              <p>In an online survey conducted last year of more than 200 chiropractors
              responding from across North America at www.backpacksafe.com, it was learned that:</p>
              <p>89 percent of chiropractors surveyed responded that they have seen patients (ages 5-18)
                reporting back, neck or shoulder pain caused by heavy backpacks.
                71 percent of chiropractors presently seeing such patients responded that they are
                currently seeing one to four patients (ages 5-18) reporting back, neck or shoulder
              pain caused by heavy backpacks.</p>
              <p>20 percent of chiropractors presently seeing such patients responded that they
                are currently seeing five to nine patients (ages 5-18) reporting back, neck or
              shoulder pain caused by heavy backpacks.</p>
              <p>9 percent of chiropractors presently seeing such patients responded that they
                are currently seeing 10 or more patients (ages 5-18) due to back, neck or shoulder
              caused by heavy backpacks.</p>
              <p>The American Chiropractic Association has offered the following tips to help
              prevent backpack problems in school children. Those tips include:</p>
              <p>Make sure your child's backpack weighs no more than 5 to 10 percent of his or her body weight.</p>
              <p>The backpack should never hang more than four inches below the waistline.
                Urge your child to wear both shoulder straps, and wide, padded straps are very important.
                The shoulder straps should be adjustable so the backpack can be fitted to your child's body.
                The over-packing of backpacks was featured in a recent study conducted in Italy. In this study
                it was found that the average child carries a backpack that would be the equivalent of a 39-pound
              burden for a 176-pound man, or a 29-pound load for a 132-pound woman.</p>

          <h4>Chiropractic Treatment for Asthma</h4>
              <h5>Dr. Ryan Marshall, D.C.</h5>
              <Card.Img className="wordWrap" style={{ width: 175 }} src="./images/womanasthma.png" />
              <p>What is Asthma?</p>
              <p>Asthma is a breathing condition that affects many people of all ages. Some
                suffer with asthma for their entire life from childhood, while others can develop
                asthma later in life (adult onset asthma). Unfortunately, asthma does not have a
                cure, and depending on the severity of the condition, it can play a debilitating
                role in a person's life.</p>
              <p>When people breathe, air is inhaled and exhaled into and out of the lungs, so
                that oxygen can be taken into the body and carbon dioxide can be expelled.
                Within the lungs, the air travels through smaller and smaller tubes until it
                reaches the bronchioles. The bronchioles have a lining that is only one cell thick,
                which allows the gas exchange between the blood and the air within the lungs.</p>
              <p>During an asthma attack, the bronchioles can spasm, swell, fill with liquid or any
                combination of these effects. As such, the air does not reach the blood as well,
                which means the person feels like he or she cannot breath. At the mildest, an
                asthma attack can cause an unpleasant feeling of not being able to catch your
                breath. At the worst, these attacks can prove to be fatal. As such, finding a
                successful method of treatment for this condition is extremely important.</p>
              <p>Treating Asthma</p>
              <p>In many cases, when a person suffers from an asthma attack, some type of
                medication is used to reduce the symptoms of the attack. There are basically
                two types of medication prescribed for those who suffer from asthma. Inhalers
                are often used to provide temporary relief during an attack, and other medicines,
                like steroids, are used by some to prevent asthma attacks from happening. As more
                and more research is done into asthma and what causes the condition, further
                treatment options besides medication are becoming available.</p>
              <p>One non-medicinal method of treating asthma is through chiropractic treatments.
                The goal of any chiropractic treatment is to find the root cause of the symptoms
                and then treat that cause and not the symptoms themselves. In the case of asthma,
                the asthma attacks are actually the symptoms and the chiropractor works to
                determine what is causing the asthma so that it can be corrected. By correcting
                this root cause, the chiropractor will be treating the patient's asthma as well.</p>
              <p>There are many causes for asthma, so it is important that the right cause is found.
                In those that have adult onset asthma, it is not uncommon to find that the asthma
                started after some kind of injury. The injury could be anything from a car accident
                to a fall or an injury while playing a sport. By pinpointing this injury or trauma
                and making any corrections through chiropractic treatments, the asthma in the patient
                can be reduced or even e</p>
              <p>Even in children or those who have had asthma since they were children, there have
                been studies that show that chiropractic treatments can help reduce the severity of the
                asthma. Based on the symptoms of asthma, there is a firm belief that the nervous system
                has a role in asthma attacks. As such, chiropractic treatments look for ways to reduce
                any pressure on the nervous system that may be affecting the lungs. One such example is
                a misalignment of the spine. If the spine is misaligned, this in turn can affect the
                nerves of the lungs. If these nerves are not functioning properly, then it is likely
                that the lungs won't function properly either. By realigning the spine, the pressure on
                the nerves will be reduced, meaning the lungs can function better.</p>
              <p>Chiropractic treatments have been used both to prevent asthma and during asthma attacks.
                Some people have found that if they have a chiropractic treatment while suffering an asthma
                attack, the treatment stops the attack and they are able to breathe normally without having
                to use any medication. There are many people who suffer from asthma and have found that with
                regular chiropractic treatments, their symptoms are either reduced or completely eliminated.</p>
